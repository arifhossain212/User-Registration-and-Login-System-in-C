# User-Registration-and-Login-System-in-C
The main objective of the User Registration and Login System is to 
manage the details of Username, Password, Login, Register respectively. 
It manages all the information about Username and Password. The project 
is totally built at administrative end and thus only the administrator 
is guaranteed the access. The purpose of the project is to build an 
application program to reduce the manual work for managing the Username, 
Password and Login. It tracks all the details about the Username and 
Password. After running the program a file named database with .txt 
extension is created. After the registration is complete the Username 
and Password of the user is written in the file. When the user login 
to system then the program checks with the file data and after matching 
the data the user can login to the system.
